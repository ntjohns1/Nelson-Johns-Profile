# Nelson-Johns-Profile
Given that potential employers want to  sample my work to prove I have the skills to be a good candidate.
When they load my portfolio they are presented with my name, a recent photo, and my contact information.
When they click on one of the links in the navigation
Then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. 
When they click on the link to the section about my work
Then they are taken to that deployed application.
When they resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices.
Then they are presented with a responsive design that adapts to their viewport.
